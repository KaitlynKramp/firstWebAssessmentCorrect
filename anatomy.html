        Although axolotls are a subspecies of salamander, they obtain certain
        qualities that are very unique. Such as, their rare condition called
        neoteny which allows them to maintain their juvenile characteristics
        into adulthood, like their feathery gills and a long dorsal fin. This
        means that, unlike salamanders, axolotls sustain a fully aquatic
        lifestyle into adulthood. They are descended from the tiger salamander
        and have inhabited central Mexico for only about the last 10 000 years.
        Scientists believe that it’s because of their stable habitat that they
        were never forced to evolve further and thus retained neoteny. The
        axolotls most notable ability is how they’re able to regenerate multiple
        body parts including their limbs, heart, parts of the brain, spinal
        cord, and lungs. In addition to regeneration, they are also remarkably
        resistant to cancer, and can also shift their hue a few shades lighter
        or darker for camouflage. The axolotl is a very interesting animal and
        has, and will continue being an interesting subject for science.
