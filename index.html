      <h2>Background on Axolotls</h2>
      <p>
        Shrouded in mystery, axolotls are one of the most interesting animals on
        our planet. These amphibians have become increasingly popular over the
        years, and have even been added into the popular game Minecraft.<a

      <p>
        The axolotl was named by the Aztec people after Xolotl, their god of
        fire and lightning, axolotl can also be translated to
        <em>Water Dog</em> because of Xolotl's dog like head, and also
        <em>Water Monster</em> since Xolotl was also the god of monsters. In
        Aztec mythology, Xolotl needed to be sacrificed so the sun could move,
        to avoid this he transformed into an axolotl to avoid capture. He was
        eventually tracked down by the wind god and sacrificed. Axolotls were
        important to the Aztec people both spiritually and as food since they
        were part of their diet. They also stirred them into a syrup as a folk
        remedy for respiratory ailments. Today, axolotls are still eaten and are
        especially popular in Japan.

      <p>
        Axolotls are native only to lake Xochimilco in the valley of Mexico, as
        well as the canals and waterways of Mexico City. Axolotls are critically
        endangered in the wild with an estimated 1000 or fewer left. This is due
        to the invasive fish in their lake and a loss of habitat due to droughts
        and human interference.
