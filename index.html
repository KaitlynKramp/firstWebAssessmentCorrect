        Shrouded in mystery, axolotls are one of the most interesting animals on
        our planet. These amphibians have become increasingly popular over the
        years, and have even been added into the popular game Minecraft.<a

        The axolotl was named by the Aztec people after Xolotl, their god of
        fire and lightning. In Aztec mythology, Xolotl needed to be sacrificed
        so the sun could move, to avoid this he transformed into an axolotl to
        avoid capture. He was eventually tracked down by the wind god and
        sacrificed. Axolotls were important to the Aztec people both spiritually
        and as food since they were part of their diet. They also stirred them
        into a syrup as a folk remedy for respiratory ailments.

        But the most impressive part about axolotls is their regenerative
        properties.
